Using Python Pandas &amp; Matplotlib to analyze and answer business questions about 12 months worth of sales data

## Project description
In this project we use Python Pandas & Python Matplotlib to analyze and answer business questions about 12 months worth of sales data. The data contains hundreds of thousands of electronics store purchases broken down by month, product type, cost, purchase address, etc...
Once we have cleaned up our data a bit We will answer high level business questions like:

       -What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?
       -What city sold the most product?
       -What time should we display advertisemens to maximize the likelihood of customerâ€™s buying product?
       -What products are most often sold together?
       -What product sold the most? Why do you think it sold the most?
