Using Python Pandas &amp; Matplotlib to analyze and answer business questions about 12 months worth of sales data

## Project description

In this project we use Python Pandas & Python Matplotlib to analyze and answer business questions about 12 months worth of sales data. As a fan of skateboarding. What's better than having our own online store where we sell skateboards and accessories. We want to create a CSV of imaginary sales for each month of last year. We're going to generate thousands of rows of product prices, addresses...We automatically generate a sales dataset in [generating_data.ipynb](https://github.com/jarnimohamed/sales_analysis/blob/master/generating_data.ipynb) .
tasks during the creation of the dataset :

* creating a simple dataframe and programmatically adding rows of product purchases to it.
* utilizing normal distributions and geometric distributions in numpy to spread out the number of purchases we make and the quantity of each item purchased.
* generating thousands of different times for each purchase with the most common times peaking around 12h and 20h.
* making a list of the most common Morroccan street addresses to help us randomly generate addresses.
* generating a realistic quantity ordered for each product We use numpy geometric distribution.
* adding multiple items being more likely to be sold together.

Now that we have our 12months worth of sales data, we move to the data exploration section in [2019_sales_analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/jarnimohamed/sales_analysis/blob/master/2019_sales_analysis.ipynb). In this section we explore 5 high level business questions related to our data:

       -What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?
       -What city sold the most product?
       -What time should we display advertisemens to maximize the likelihood of customerâ€™s buying product?
       -What products are most often sold together?
       -What product sold the most? Why do you think it sold the most?
